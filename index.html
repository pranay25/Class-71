<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">i had visited in dec 2018</h5>
<p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible

 <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or youâ€™ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

 <p>4/4 To celebrate early for the 30th year anniversary, I finally get to review the most beloved Disney animated film of all time. While I do have significant fondness for Jon Favreau's realistic remake that pays respectable tribute, I still love this animated triumph of a masterpiece, as it holds a special place in my heart. From beginning to end, "The Lion King" is a spectacular epic for the animation genre, and a surefire crowd-pleaser for families as it strikes at an exquisite balance between comedy that is witty and hilarious, and drama that is harrowing and personal with haunting set-pieces, including the chill-inducing wildebeest stampede. There is an awe-inspiring sense of ambition, as well as breathtaking intensity. The enthralling story really spoke out to me; It is a coming-of-age story that possesses layers and some details to make it more intriguing. It was inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet (a dark revenge story), and by the characteristics of real lions; like all lion (as cubs), Simba and Nala are born to fight, but not brave enough to take on enemies nor responsibility just yet. It also delivers profound messages about difficult changes in one's life, learn from your mistakes in the past, and growing up by taking responsibility. Every scene is superbly-staged and unforgettable with perfect timing and how the images were constructed. The animation is dynamic; it's a seamless blend of hand-drawn illustrations and computer generated effects. The depiction of Africa here is an artistic marvel; a majestic, sweeping wonderland showcasing it's sheer magnitude in epic scope. The color scheme is well-utilized, while the character designs are amazingly drawn with evocative facial expressions and appealing details. The impeccable cast provides considerable personalities to create strong characterizations, and I thoroughly enjoyed the voice performances by the cast. As a cub, Johnathan Thomas matches Simba's cheeky and curious personality, while Matthew Broderick is involving with great suitability for Simba as an adult. James Earl Jones was pitch-perfect as Mufasa with his resonant voice; sounding sophisticated, assertive, and warm-hearted. The comedic sidekicks are very snappy and sprightly, from Rowan Atkinson as Zazu the melodramatic Hornbill, to Nathan Land and Ernie Sabella as Timon the wisecracking Meerkat and Pumbaa the joyous warthog. Robert Guillamue was fantastic as Rafiki the mandrill who provides quirky humor and inspiring spirituality. Jeremy Irons provided a well-rounded fusion of ominous malice and dry sarcastic humor via wicked voice acting to reflect the campy personality of Scar, a deceitful and sinister opponent who plans to take his place as king. Noticing his dark, black mane, it is a clear sign that Scar is a strong, healthy male lion. Scar has an army of hyenas, and they are just as vicious and humorous. All 5 songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are beautifully catchy. The awesome music score by Hans Zimmer delivers stirring compositions to enhance the film with powerful admiration. 
Highly Recommended (suitable for kids 6 and up)..</p>
